		<p>Here's a cool fact from the PDSA!</p>
		<blockquote cite = 'https://www.pdsa.org.uk/what-we-do/blog/10-amazing-facts-about-dogs'>
		The area of cells in the brain that detect different smells is around 40 times larger in dogs than humans. This means that your dog can pick up on way more smells than we ever could. This is why dogs are often used to sniff out people, drugs and even money!
